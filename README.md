# twitter-solitare-bot
Junk made for fun

This bot is a faithful Accordian solitare player for twitter.
Which is to say, you can play accordian solitare with it.

# WHY THO?
Well this is obstensively for the general moters twitter bot challenge.
But more importantly, I chose this version of solitare because the game state is entirely visible.
Meaning I didn't have to keep track of anything over the course of the game as the previous tweet had everything.
I could have done klondike solitare in a similar way, where instead of keeping track of where cards are, just give a random card.
However, the problem with that approach is that then drawing a card from the top deck would be both infinite and could duplicate.
Thus instead of trying to make a systemw where I kept track of it, through searching previous tweets. I did something far more simple

# DOES THIS WORK?
I actually have no idea because I wasn't given a twitter developer account by the time the challenge was finished.
The code I wrote for the cards works, but all the code using the Twitter API specifically is not tested.
I believe it should work, but who is to say.
